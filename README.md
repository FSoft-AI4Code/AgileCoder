## Overview
***AgileCoder*** integrates Agile Methodology into a multi-agent system framework, enabling a collaborative environment where software agents assume specific Agile roles such as Product Manager, Scrum Master, Developer, Senior Developer, and Tester. These agents work together to develop software efficiently and iteratively, simulating a dynamic and adaptive software development team.

In AgileCoder, each agent is not just a participant but a stakeholder in the software development process, engaging in sprints that mimic real-world Agile practices. This setup enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of development workflows, aligning closely with modern software engineering demands. The system is designed to handle the complexities of real-world software projects, supporting incremental development and continuous integration seamlessly.


Key Features of ***AgileCoder***:
- Dynamic Role Assignment: Agents dynamically assume roles based on the project needs and user inputs, ensuring flexibility and optimal resource utilization.
- Sprint-Based Development: The framework organizes development tasks into sprints, promoting rapid prototyping and frequent reassessment of project goals.
- Dynamic Code Graph Generator: This innovative module automatically generates and updates a dependency graph whenever the codebase changes, enhancing the agentsâ€™ understanding of the code structure and interdependencies. This feature is crucial for maintaining high accuracy in code generation and modifications.
